    In `split-kolla-ansible-site.py`, PyYAML is now used instead of ruamel.yaml. In
    ruamel.yaml as of version 0.18, various things were deprecated which relativised
    the added value of ruamel.yaml. Using PyYAML does not change the content of the
    modified files. Only the formatting of the syntax is now different.
